<h1>Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Welcome to my blog!

I'm a web developer by trade, with an eye on improving the developer experience.

Case in point, my [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/) project is a collection of WebAuthn libraries to help developers build more secure authentication. And in my spare time at work I maintain Duo Labs' [py_webauthn](https://github.com/duo-labs/py_webauthn) and [webauthn.io](https://webauthn.io) to help others benefit from and explore passkeys.

From time to time I give [presentations](/categories/presentations/) about how developers can navigate and embrace new technologies in the authentication and identity spaces (because I accidentally became really passionate about WebAuthn and passkeys.)

When I'm not [blogging](/) or [working on open-source](https://github.com/MasterKale), I'm probably [gaming](/gaming/) or 3D printing. If you want to contact me just hit me up at any of the links below ðŸ‘‡
