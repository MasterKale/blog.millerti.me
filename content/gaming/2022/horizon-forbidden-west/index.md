## Notes

For better or for worse this is more of Horizon Zero Dawn...but with a few new gameplay mechanics and a *way* crazier storyline than the first allowed. Overall the mechanics seem very similar to the first game: buy gadgets, hunt beasts for items to upgrade, and occasionally pick up some new duds. I don't remember a leveling up system for the armor, so that seems new, though it may just be it's been that long since I last played HZD.

I admit I've only just come across the first real plot twist, and it caught me by surprise so now I have no idea anymore where they game is going to take things. It was surprising enough to make me want to go back and see what happens, even if I'm not particularly enthused to go back to the "stealth is the way" gameplay that makes every encounter right now a bit slow to get past. I assume that as I get back into the swing of things, and accumulate better armor and weapons, I'll figure out a more dynamic game play style, but for now it's still very much:

1. Sneak up and find cover
2. Scan
3. Start sniping off the important bits

That said the feedback the game gives when you hit that robo-elk's acid canisters is just :chefkiss:

As of June 2022 this game sits second-from-the-top of my backlog (below the newly-purchased Ratchet and Clank A Rift Apart. $40! *Can you believe it?*) Going back to HFW will probably be the nice, action-y cooldown I need after the 3+ month-long [Elden Ring]({{< ref "elden-ring" >}}) bender I've been on, though - I'm not yet ready to throw in the towel on this one...
