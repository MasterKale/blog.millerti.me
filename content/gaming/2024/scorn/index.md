Talk about a visual aesthetic in search of gameplay. The clunky controls and awful automatic checkpoints had me drop this game just a couple hours in.

It's a shame because I *love* the H.R. Giger aesthetic. The unnerving combination of flesh and machinery makes for really provocative imagery, and has inspired countless unsettling, iconic character designs over the years.

I'm only taking some time to write about this game because I don't want myself to forget that, if I ever try to finish the game, I'm in for a bad time despite my desire to look at everything. Just watch a Let's Play on YouTube instead.
