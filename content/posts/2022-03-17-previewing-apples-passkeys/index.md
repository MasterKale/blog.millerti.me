Last year at WWDC 2021 Apple [announced a tech preview of their upcoming "passkeys"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10106/). These were otherwise normal WebAuthn credentials, except their private key material would get synced between devices via iCloud Keychain! In one fell swoop Apple had seemingly offered up a solution to users getting locked out of their WebAuthn-protected accounts if they lost their phone.

Nearly a year later I decided to capture the current state of these passkeys. It'll be nice to have something to compare against whatever Apple ends up officially launching, maybe this year at WWDC 2022.

## Setup

Activating passkeys on macOS 12.2.1 was a simple as enabling Safari's developer tools, then clicking **Develop > Enable Syncing Platform Authenticator**:

Getting iOS 15.4 to support syncing platform authenticators was a little more involved. [Here's how Apple said to do it](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/public-private_key_authentication/supporting_passkeys):

> In iOS, turn on the Syncing Platform Authenticator switch under Settings > Developer. The Developer menu is available on your device when you set it up as a development device in Xcode.

Practically speaking this meant downloading Xcode from the Mac App Store, creating a new throwaway project, then plugging my iPhone into my MacBook for a few seconds once the project finished loading. This allowed me to then go to **Settings > Developer** on my phone and flip the **Syncing Platform Authenticator** toggle to On:

## Registration - macOS

Passkey registration didn't really change how `navigator.credentials.create()` was called. So long as I allowed platform authenticators to be registered, Safari explicitly prompted me to "save a passkey":

![Safari 15.3 prompting the user to save a passkey during WebAuthn registration](images/safari_15.3_passkey_registration.png)

Clicking **Save** returned a credential, and the registration ceremony successfully completed as expected.

Curiously, passkeys only supported `"none"` attestation. Requesting `"direct"` attestation resulted in an ambiguous error:

![Safari 15.3 failing registration when direct attestation is requested](images/safari_15.3_failure_direct_attestation.png)

## Authentication - macOS

Options passed to `navigator.credentials.get()` were also unaffected. Worth noting was my ability to populate `allowCredentials` or leave it an empty array. Either way Safari displayed a list of passkeys so that I could "sign in...using a saved account":

![Safari 15.3 showing the user a list of saved accounts to authenticate with](images/safari_15.3_authenticate_usernameless.png)

Selecting a passkey from the list returned it from the WebAuthn API call, and the authentication ceremony succeeded as expected.

## Authentication - iOS

Notice how I skipped "Registration - iOS"? This is where passkeys shine through: they became immediately available to authenticate on my iPhone! This was as simple as authenticating on the iPhone afterwards:

![Demonstrating immediate authentication via Face ID on an iPhone after macOS registration](images/ios_15.4_authentication.gif)

The reverse of all of this was true too - if I cleared synced platform credentials and then registered a passkey on the iPhone, I could then authenticate on macOS a few moments later with the same credential (I *did* have to give iCloud Keychain maybe 15 seconds to synchronize the new credential).

## Closing Thoughts

All in all I have to say I'm pretty excited for passkeys. I think it's a great solution for WebAuthn account recovery, since now it's as simple as signing into your iCloud account on a new device to regain access to all of your credentials. The fact that the synchronization happens automatically is a huge convenience win for users too since there's nothing to think about.

I *had* hoped this would mean the end of browser-specific credential stores on macOS for an OS-level store like on iOS, but alas, Apple seems to be keeping this exclusive to macOS Safari for now.

Speaking to RP devs for a moment: passkeys in general will largely be transparent to current implementations of WebAuthn. Upcoming additions to L3 of the WebAuthn spec, like [additional authData flags indicating backup state](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/pull/1695) and [a new `devicePubKey` extension ](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/pull/1663), will eventually help RPs maintain the "single-device" aspect of pre-passkey WebAuthn credentials.

If Apple goes live with passkeys later this year then most RPs will start receiving multi-device credentials before they are (read: can be) aware of it. I don't think this is worth worrying about because of the high level of security of the various platforms' syncing fabrics. Not to mention how it'll potentially decrease customer support requests by users who were locked out of their WebAuthn-protected accounts because they traded in or lost their phone.

Some final bits of passkey trivia:

- **Technically speaking a "passkey" is a "multi-device credential".** This means it's available for use on multiple machines through some kind of backup/sync/export mechanism that is outside the scope of WebAuthn. Credentials generated prior to the launch of any one passkey solution *or* via the upcoming `devicePubKey` extension can be referred to as a "single-device credential"; this asserts that the credential is bound to the piece of hardware that generated it.
- **Passkeys imply discoverable credentials 100% of the time.** This means that, during a WebAuthn authentication ceremony, `allowCredentials` can contain a list of credential IDs, or can be an empty array to signal to the browser that it should prompt the user to choose a credential to log in with.
- **Passkeys will most likely be locked to specific platforms.** Since the major platform vendors (Microsoft, Google, Apple) are using their respective clouds to sync credentials between devices it's unlikely we'll see a _single_ passkey be usable across every device. I think best case scenario, if passkeys see wide adoption, is that RPs will "only" need to keep track of up to three passkeys per user. Time will tell if this ends up being the case, or if something else comes out to simplify things even more.
  - Will [Google's caBLE v2]({{< ref "../2021-06-18-previewing-chrome-webauthn-support-for-cable-v2" >}}) change this arithmetic? Perhaps it'll let us get down to two: Apple's that is usable across iOS and macOS, and an Android-based passkey that can auth on both Windows and Android. Could we achieve "a single passkey across all platforms" if everyone agreed to support caBLE v2...? ðŸ¤”
