## Description

You've decided to "go passwordless", but your users are confused by it all:

- "Why is my browser asking me to choose between Security Key or This Device?"
- "Why does the site show an error when I try to log in with my phone?"
- "I registered in Chrome, but Safari won't let me log inâ€¦help!"

Though Relying Parties have almost no ability to customize the browser modals that walk users through WebAuthn ceremonies, there are plenty of techniques you can use to craft a pleasant passwordless experience. Join me for some time-saving tips to help you tailor the registration and authentication ceremonies to remove confusion and empower your users to securely go about their day.
