## Description

Over the past few years we've seen a meteoric rise in MFA adoption. It's been driven in part by the pandemic and by development of easier authentication experiences for end users.

Join two FIDO WebAuthn experts to get hands-on with going passwordless and learn how to leverage new FIDO features to provide streamlined auth flows with less passwords today.
