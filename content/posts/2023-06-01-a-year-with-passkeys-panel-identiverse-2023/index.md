## Description

Can you believe it's been over a year since passkeys were announced?! And what an exciting year it has been as we continue making progress towards pushing passwords out of our lives for good! Join us for a panel discussion with subject matter experts from Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and the FIDO Alliance. We'll look back at the first year of passkeys in the wild, from device and OS support to adoption and developer experiences. Panelists will share what they've learned and what the future holds. They'll shed insights into what challenges may lie ahead as passkeys inch towards replacing passwords and becoming the phishing-resistant default credential for the web.
