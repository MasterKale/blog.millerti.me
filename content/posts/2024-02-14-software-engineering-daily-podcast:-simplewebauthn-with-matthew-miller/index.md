![The podcast episode image art features the words "SimpleWebAuthn with Matthew Miller", with my name in red. Below that is the Software Engineering Daily logo of a laptop, and to the right of their logo is the SimpleWebAuthn "S" from simplewebauthn.dev (I wish they'd given me a chance to choose something better!)](images/New-SimpleWebAuthn-with-Matthew-Miller.png)

I recently appeared on the [Software Engineering Daily podcast to talk about my work on SimpleWebAuthn](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/02/14/simplewebauthn-with-matthew-miller/)! Here's the summary of everything we talked about:

> SimpleWebAuthn is an open source TypeScript-centric pair of libraries ‚Äì frontend and backend ‚Äì that make it easier for devs to implement WebAuthn on the web.
>
> Matthew Miller started the project in 2019 and it has grown in tandem with the popularization of WebAuthn. He joins the podcast today to talk about the history of the project starting from the first commit, the problems it solves, its design, and more.
>
> Gregor Vand is a security-focused technologist, and is the founder and CTO of Mailpass. Previously, Gregor was a CTO across cybersecurity, cyber insurance and general software engineering companies. He has been based in Asia Pacific for almost a decade and can be found via his profile at vand.hk.

It was great to be asked to guest appear about my work on [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev) - it's always been hard to gauge how aware people outside of GitHub are of my work. If anything sounds out of date I apologize, we recorded things back in November!

Their site includes [a transcript](http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SED1634-SED1634_SimpleWebAuthn.txt) and a web player to listen to the episode. It‚Äôs also available in your preferred podcast app - I listened to it in [Pocket Casts](https://pca.st/w0pc3rxq) no problem üëç
