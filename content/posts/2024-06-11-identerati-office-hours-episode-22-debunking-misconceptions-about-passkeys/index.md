## Description

There have been a few blog posts (and resulting social media and forum discussions) going around the past few weeks about #passkeys, mostly painting them (or organizations who have been working hard to bring passkeys to users all over the world) in a negative light. Many of the responses have been accusatory, conspiratorial, or just plain incorrect.

In this episode Tim and Matthew are going to discuss the top misconceptions.
