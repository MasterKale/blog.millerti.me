Just a quick update, I've added all of the talks I've given at industry conferences since 2022. They're all here under the new **presentations** category so I have a single place to share around when people ask:

[**/categories/presentations/**](/categories/presentations/)

Videos and slides are included when available. As of today I've got four presentations and one panel across Authenticate 2022, Authenticate 2023, and Identiverse 2023. I'll definitely have more to add this year as Authenticate 2024 is right around the corner... ðŸ‘€

(TBD what might be a good way to link to the Internet Identity Workshop sessions I called at IIW 36 and IIW 38...)
