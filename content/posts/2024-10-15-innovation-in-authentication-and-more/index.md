## Description

Authentication is a complicated problem with ever-creeping scope. Passkeys provide phishing-resistance at the point of authentication, but you need protection at enrollment and during the authenticated session thereafter, too, to truly fortify the authentication process against evolving threats.

In this discussion, authentication experts Chris Anderson and Matthew Miller will walk through all the components of a user authentication workflow, highlighting areas of innovation and future steps for securing enrollment, authentication, and sessions.
